<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project to get a qr code of the current url. Almost the same as the [url to qr code](https://github.com/smoqadam/url-to-qrcode-firefox-addon) extension for Firefox, but i like the idea of [this issue](https://github.com/smoqadam/url-to-qrcode-firefox-addon/issues/13) and seems a good side project.
